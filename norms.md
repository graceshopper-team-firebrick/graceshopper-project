Establishing Norms

Each group should discuss and provide an answer for the following questions

What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?
	
	Get a third’s person opinion, if not all four


What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go.

A person should help the frustrated person. Expect the person to ask for help on their end
Ask person whether he’s missing commits or if they’re stuck on a certain part
	
What does this group do when we merge our work together?
Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?

When does this group ask for help?
After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?
	
Anyone that is available can help solve the problem, if doesn’t work then ask for outside help

How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?
Default to solo, start pairing if necessary

How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?
